# Fitness Monitor v2 Overview
## Structure
This file outlines the structure and architecture of the version two fitness monitor project. It extends version one, summarised in [fitness-monitor-v1-overview](fitness-monitor-v1-overview.md). The version two fitness monitor implements a significantly refined structure. This refactor was performed to port the fitness monitor to use a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) as required for this project. This implementation is detailed in [rtos-implementation](./RTOS-implementation.md). The specifc architecture is explained and justified in [architecture-justification](./architecture-justification.md)
